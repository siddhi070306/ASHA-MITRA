# ASHA Mitra (आशा मित्र) - AI-Powered Voice Triage Assistant for ASHA Workers

## Overview

ASHA Mitra is an AI-powered,platform built to empower ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers in rural India with instant clinical decision support. It acts as an intelligent digital companion that enables healthcare workers to assess patient conditions using voice, classify medical urgency, generate digital referrals, and securely verify records using blockchain technology.

The platform addresses challenges such as poor connectivity, language barriers, paper-based record management, and lack of structured triage systems in rural healthcare.

# Problem Statement

India's rural healthcare system depends heavily on ASHA workers who often serve as the first point of medical contact. However, they face several critical challenges:

- No standardized clinical decision-support system
- Manual paper-based patient records
- Poor internet connectivity in remote villages
- Multiple regional languages and literacy barriers
- Lack of legal proof of patient assessment
- Delayed identification of emergency cases

These limitations often result in delayed referrals, inconsistent assessments, and preventable maternal and infant mortality.

# Solution

ASHA Mitra provides an AI-assisted healthcare ecosystem that works even in offline environments.

The application enables ASHA workers to:

- Record patient symptoms using voice
- Perform AI-powered clinical triage
- Generate digital referral slips
- Securely store patient records
- Verify assessments using blockchain

# Deployment on Vercel

Since the repository contains separate frontend and backend applications, you will deploy them as two separate projects on Vercel.

## 1. Backend Deployment

1. Go to your **Vercel Dashboard** and click **Add New** -> **Project**.
2. Connect your GitHub repository.
3. In the project settings, set the **Root Directory** to `backend`.
4. Vercel will automatically detect `backend/vercel.json` and deploy the Express API.
5. Configure the following **Environment Variables** in the project settings:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your persistent MongoDB Atlas URI.
   - `SARVAM_API_KEY`: Your Sarvam Speech API Key.
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API Key.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secure random key for JWT signing.
6. Click **Deploy** and copy your deployed backend URL (e.g. `https://asha-mitra-backend.vercel.app`).

## 2. Frontend Deployment

1. Go to your **Vercel Dashboard** and click **Add New** -> **Project**.
2. Connect the same GitHub repository.
3. In the project settings:
   - Set the **Root Directory** to `frontend`.
   - Set the **Framework Preset** to `Vite`.
4. Configure the following **Environment Variable** in the project settings:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: Set this to your deployed backend URL from step 1 (including `https://`).
5. Click **Deploy**. Vercel will read `frontend/vercel.json` to handle client-side routing properly.
